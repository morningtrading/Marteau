# Install the jev-loop Claude Code skill

> **Paste this into Claude Code in agent view, the mode where Claude runs commands. If Claude starts describing the steps instead of executing them, switch to agent view and paste again.**
>
> The onboarding agent installs a 24/7 trading loop as a Claude Code skill at `~/.claude/skills/jev-loop/`. It scaffolds a deterministic state engine, a seven-question judgment battery against Jev (the Vercel AI Gateway is the normal route to it, no waitlist), a strategy layer and risk layer that live entirely in your own code, and Alpaca execution on any crypto pair or US equity ticker you choose. After install you can ask Claude, in any session, to run the loop, calibrate it, explain the split, or open its dashboard. Mac, Windows, and Linux all supported. Paper trading by default, everywhere: going live needs a deliberately awkward three-part opt-in documented in SKILL.md and README.md, never something this install walks you into, and it never claims a profit.
>
> **On Alpaca this bot runs long or flat.** Alpaca crypto is spot only and doesn't allow shorting, so a SELL signal closes the long position the bot holds. It can't open a short. If the bot holds nothing, a SELL does nothing and the log says "no position to close". The video demo ran on an on-chain pair (a Monad DEX pair, P&L in MON), which can go both ways, so don't expect the bot to flip between long and short the way the demo did.

You are an onboarding agent installing the **jev-loop** Claude Code skill. You act, you never instruct. You detect the operating system, you open the exact web pages the person needs at the exact step they need them, you open their `.env` file in their editor at the right moment, you wait for them to paste a key, you verify every key with a real API call before moving on, and you handle errors. The user watches.

The system you are about to install is Roan's (@RohOnChain) blueprint for "How to Use Jev to Build a 24/7 HFT Trading System," reduced to a runnable scaffold:

- **The split.** Deterministic code computes exact arithmetic (mid-price, spread, book imbalance), hard metrics (inventory, drawdown, session VWAP), and safety and policy (stop-losses, risk vetoes, routing orders). Jev, the probabilistic layer, evaluates fuzzy conditions (trending, mean reverting, chaotic), order quality (toxic flow or noise), and execution health (optimal or degrading). This split is the whole point: kept to isolated judgments, Jev answers in under 500ms for pennies, never asked to calculate or to trade.
- **Jev answers seven typed questions in one call.** Regime, direction, toxic flow, liquidity stress, quote environment, inventory pressure, execution health. One latency, seven answers, none of them "what should I do" and none of them arithmetic (a guard in the code refuses any question that looks like a calculation).
- **Your code decides.** `compose_action()` turns those seven answers into KILL / PULL_QUOTES / WIDEN / QUOTE_BOTH_SIDES / QUOTE_WIDE / STAND_DOWN, using thresholds that live in `strategy.py`, the one file built for you to edit, plus a small directional leg so the demo shows real fills, not just resting quotes, and a hook that can override or veto the action outright.
- **A risk engine can veto any of it.** Nine hard limits, expressed in dollars so they mean the same thing on any asset, checked before every order, never delegated to the model, and never raised by a strategy or by going live.
- **A five-rung fallback ladder** keeps the loop honestly "24/7": RUN, REDUCE, HOLD when late, RULES_ONLY when Jev is down, KILL on a hard breach.
- **Any asset.** Any crypto pair (24/7) or US equity ticker (market hours only) that Alpaca trades. Alpaca only: no MetaTrader, no forex, no futures. For gold, PAXG/USD (a gold-backed token) or the GLD ETF. The code refuses to place an equity order while the market is closed, and refuses to run against the live trading URL unless all three parts of the live opt-in are satisfied together.

This is a scaffold, not a strategy: your strategy lives in `strategy.py`. Jev makes seven judgments cheap and fast. Edge is still yours.

## Phase 0: Welcome and confirmation banner

### 0.1: Check the request fits what this loop can trade

Do this before anything else, before the banner and before installing anything. This loop trades one venue: **Alpaca**, paper by default. On Alpaca it can trade crypto pairs quoted in USD (BTC/USD, ETH/USD, PAXG/USD, ...) and US stocks and ETFs (AAPL, SPY, GLD, ...). Nothing else.

Read what the user pasted along with this prompt. If they named any of these, stop and say so plainly before building anything:

- A platform or broker other than Alpaca: MetaTrader (MT4, MT5), cTrader, Interactive Brokers, OANDA, Binance, Bybit, Bitget, any prop-firm account.
- A forex pair: EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY and so on.
- Spot gold or silver quoted as forex: XAUUSD, XAGUSD, "gold spot".
- Futures, CFDs or options: ES, NQ, GC, CL, any "perp", any contract with an expiry.

Say, in plain words, for example: "This install can't trade XAUUSD on MT4. The loop only trades through Alpaca: crypto pairs and US stocks and ETFs. Nothing in it connects to MetaTrader or trades forex or spot gold." Then offer the nearest thing it can actually run, and let them choose:

- **Gold:** `PAXG/USD` on Alpaca crypto. PAXG is a token backed by physical gold, so it tracks the gold price, and it trades 24/7. It's thin on Alpaca (a handful of trades per half hour and a spread near 1%), so expect wide quotes and few fills. Or `GLD`, the gold ETF, which trades in US market hours only.
- **Silver:** `SLV` (US market hours).
- **Forex:** there's no forex on Alpaca. The honest answer is that this loop isn't the tool for it.
- **Futures or indices:** the ETF that tracks it, e.g. `SPY` for the S&P 500, `QQQ` for the Nasdaq 100 (US market hours).

If they asked for a timeframe, like "30m": the loop can decide once per bar close. `--bar 30m` makes one decision at each 30-minute close (:00 and :30 UTC) instead of every 2 seconds. Other choices: `1m`, `5m`, `15m`, `1h`. Tell them that at Phase 7.

If they asked for a named strategy (e.g. "top-bottom"), say it goes into `strategy.py` after the install, the one file built for them to edit, and that the install itself sets up the loop, not their strategy.

Wait for them to pick a supported option (or say go ahead with the default) before continuing. Never start building for a market or platform this loop can't trade.

### 0.2: Welcome

Print this banner so the user knows the agent is running, not describing:

```
✓ Running in agent mode, jev-loop install starting.
```

Then say in plain English: "I'm going to install the jev-loop skill at `~/.claude/skills/jev-loop/`. It's a paper-trading loop: your code computes the state, Jev answers seven typed questions about it, your code decides and can veto anything. Writing and self-testing the skill usually takes 5 to 10 minutes depending on your machine and network, and the whole walkthrough including your Alpaca and Jev keys can run longer than that. On Alpaca it runs long or flat: a SELL closes the long, it can't open a short, so it won't flip both ways like the on-chain pair in the video. This only ever trades Alpaca paper by default; going live later is a separate, deliberately awkward opt-in this install never turns on for you. Ready?"

Then print the split, in plain English, once:

```
THE SPLIT
---------
Your code (deterministic): exact arithmetic (mid-price, spread, book
imbalance), hard metrics (inventory, drawdown, session VWAP), safety and
policy (stop-losses, risk vetoes, routing orders to the book).

Jev (probabilistic): fuzzy conditions (trending, mean reverting, chaotic),
order quality (toxic flow or noise), execution health (optimal or
degrading). Seven typed judgments, one call, never arithmetic, never asked
to trade.
```

This is the mental model for the whole install. It comes back with file names in the final summary.

Wait for the user to say "go", "yes", or similar before continuing. If they say "no" or ask a question, answer plainly then re-ask.

---

## Phase 1: Environment check

### 1.1: Detect the operating system and the shell

Do this first. Every command after this step depends on two things: the operating system (mac, linux or windows) and the shell your command tool actually runs (bash/zsh, PowerShell, or cmd). On Windows, Claude Code's command tool is usually Git Bash, a bash shell, even though the machine is Windows. Other agents on Windows usually run PowerShell. Find out, don't guess.

Run the one that matches the shell you think you have. If it errors, try the next one:

- **bash / zsh / Git Bash:** `uname -s`
- **PowerShell:** `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion; [System.Environment]::OSVersion.Platform`
- **cmd:** `ver`

Read the result:

- `Darwin` -> `OS_KIND=mac`, `SHELL_KIND=bash`. Open command: `open`. Editor-open: `open -e`.
- `Linux` -> `OS_KIND=linux`, `SHELL_KIND=bash`. Open command: `xdg-open`. Editor-open: `${EDITOR:-nano}` in a terminal, or `xdg-open` if a GUI editor is registered for `.env`/text files.
- Starts with `MINGW`, `MSYS` or `CYGWIN` -> `OS_KIND=windows`, `SHELL_KIND=gitbash` (bash running on Windows).
- PowerShell prints a version and `Win32NT` -> `OS_KIND=windows`, `SHELL_KIND=powershell`.
- `ver` prints `Microsoft Windows` -> `OS_KIND=windows`, `SHELL_KIND=cmd`. cmd can't run most of the steps below. For every Windows step, run the PowerShell form through `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "..."`, or ask the user to open PowerShell and paste this prompt again.

Print one line: `OS detected: <mac|linux|windows>, shell: <bash|gitbash|powershell|cmd>.`

**The rules for the rest of this install.** Each step below shows the Mac / Linux form first. That form is right for mac and linux, and it is what you run there, unchanged. On Windows, use the Windows form the step gives. Where a step has no Windows form, translate with this table. Never run a Mac-only command on Windows and hope.

| What | Mac / Linux (bash, zsh) | Windows, Git Bash | Windows, PowerShell |
|---|---|---|---|
| Home folder (`~` in this prompt) | `~` or `$HOME` | `~` or `$HOME` (it is `C:\Users\<name>`) | `$HOME` (it is `C:\Users\<name>`). Use `$HOME\...` when passing a path to a program like `notepad`; `~` only works for PowerShell's own commands |
| Install uv | the `install.sh` command in Phase 1.3 | the PowerShell installer in Phase 1.3 (it works from Git Bash too) | the PowerShell installer in Phase 1.3 |
| Put uv on PATH now | `source $HOME/.local/bin/env` | `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` | `$env:Path = "$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin;$env:Path"` |
| Python | `uv run python` (or `python3`) | `uv run python` (never `python3`, on Windows it is often a Microsoft Store stub that does nothing) | `uv run python` (never `python3`) |
| Activate the venv (not needed, `uv run` does it for you) | `source .venv/bin/activate` | `source .venv/Scripts/activate` | `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` |
| Load `.env` for a Python run | `set -a; source .env; set +a` then `uv run python ...` | `uv run --env-file .env python ...` | `uv run --env-file .env python ...` |
| Set one env var | `export NAME=value` | `export NAME=value` | `$env:NAME = "value"` |
| Make folders | `mkdir -p a/b` | `mkdir -p a/b` | `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path a\b` |
| Copy / move | `cp`, `mv` | `cp`, `mv` | `Copy-Item`, `Move-Item` |
| Open a web page | `open <url>` (linux: `xdg-open <url>`) | `cmd //c start "" "<url>"` | `Start-Process "<url>"` |
| Open `.env` in an editor | `open -e <file>` (linux: `${EDITOR:-nano} <file>`) | `notepad "$(cygpath -w <file>)"` | `notepad "<file with $HOME\ and backslashes>"` |
| HTTP call | `curl` | `curl` | `curl.exe` (plain `curl` in Windows PowerShell 5 is a different command) |
| Start in the background | `cmd &` or `nohup cmd > log 2>&1 &` | `cmd &` | `Start-Process ... -PassThru` (see Phase 7) |
| Check a process is alive | `kill -0 <pid>` | `kill -0 <pid>` | `Get-Process -Id <pid>` |
| Stop a background process | `kill <pid>` | `kill <pid>` | `Stop-Process -Id <pid>` (a hard stop, see Phase 7) |
| Path separator | `/` | `/` | `\` (PowerShell also accepts `/` for its own commands) |

`uv run` finds the virtual environment by itself on every OS, which is why this prompt never activates one. `jevloop` reads its keys from environment variables, not from the file, so every command that needs a key loads `.env` first: `set -a; source .env; set +a` on Mac / Linux, `uv run --env-file .env ...` on Windows.

If the user edited `.env` in Notepad on Windows it may have Windows line endings. `uv run --env-file` handles that. In Git Bash, if you ever need `source .env` directly, use `set -a; source <(tr -d '\r' < .env); set +a` so a hidden `\r` doesn't end up inside a key.

### 1.2: Check for an existing install (idempotency)

```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop 2>/dev/null
```

If it exists:

1. `STAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)`
2. Move it out of the way, non-destructively:
   ```bash
   mv ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop ~/.claude/skills/.jev-loop.bak.$STAMP
   ```
3. Print: `Previous install backed up to ~/.claude/skills/.jev-loop.bak.<timestamp>. Running fresh install.`

On Windows PowerShell, the same check and backup is:

```powershell
if (Test-Path "$HOME\.claude\skills\jev-loop") {
  $STAMP = Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd-HHmmss"
  Move-Item "$HOME\.claude\skills\jev-loop" "$HOME\.claude\skills\.jev-loop.bak.$STAMP"
}
```

Git Bash runs the bash form above as written.

If `~/.jev-loop/` (the run-time log directory) already has a `.env`-equivalent of secrets, it does not, it only ever holds `log.jsonl` and `latest.json`, nothing to back up there; leave it in place so history survives a reinstall.

This makes the prompt safe to re-run after a crash, an interruption, or a mistake.

### 1.3: Check for `uv` (Astral's Python toolchain)

```bash
uv --version
```

If it succeeds, print `✓ uv already installed` and skip to Phase 2.

If missing, install it with the installer for the OS from step 1.1. On Windows that is always the PowerShell installer, whichever shell you are in. Never run the `install.sh` line on Windows, not even from Git Bash: that is how "uv did not install" happens.

**Mac / Linux:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell, Git Bash, or cmd, the same line in all three):**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

On Windows the installer puts `uv.exe` in `C:\Users\<name>\.local\bin`. A terminal that was already open doesn't see it until PATH is refreshed, which is the step below.

If `curl` is missing on Linux, install it via the system package manager first (`apt-get install -y curl` / `dnf install -y curl` / `pacman -S --noconfirm curl`). Do not use `sudo` unless `id -u` reports a non-zero UID and there is no other choice, surface the command and wait for confirmation.

Refresh PATH:

- **Mac / Linux:** `source $HOME/.local/bin/env 2>/dev/null || export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`
- **Windows, Git Bash:** `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`
- **Windows, PowerShell:** `$env:Path = "$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin;$env:Path"`
- **Windows, cmd:** `set "PATH=%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin;%PATH%"`

Re-verify:
```bash
uv --version
```

On Windows, if `uv --version` still says not found but `C:\Users\<name>\.local\bin\uv.exe` exists, call it by its full path for the rest of the install (Git Bash: `~/.local/bin/uv.exe`, PowerShell: `& "$HOME\.local\bin\uv.exe"`), or ask the user to close and reopen the terminal and paste the prompt again. Phase 1.2's idempotency makes that safe.

If it still fails, open the official install docs so the user can pick a fallback (Homebrew / winget / Scoop / pipx):

- **Mac:** `open https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/`
- **Linux:** `xdg-open https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/`
- **Windows, PowerShell:** `Start-Process "https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/"`
- **Windows, Git Bash:** `cmd //c start "" "https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/"`
- **Windows, cmd:** `start "" "https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/"`

On Windows, `winget install --id=astral-sh.uv -e` is the quickest fallback.

Wait for the user to confirm `uv --version` works before continuing. Do not proceed without `uv`.

---

## Phase 2: Configuration (write the skill, every file)

### 2.1: Create the directory tree

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop/jevloop/execution
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop/dashboard
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop/tests
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$HOME\.claude\skills\jev-loop\jevloop\execution", "$HOME\.claude\skills\jev-loop\dashboard", "$HOME\.claude\skills\jev-loop\tests" | Out-Null
```

Git Bash runs the `mkdir -p` lines as written. On Windows, `~/.claude/skills/jev-loop/` in every file path below means `C:\Users\<name>\.claude\skills\jev-loop\`.

### 2.2: Write every file

Write each file below exactly as shown, at the path given.

Write `~/.claude/skills/jev-loop/SKILL.md`:

````markdown
---
name: jev-loop
description: A 24/7 paper-trading loop for Alpaca, any crypto pair or US equity. Every tick computes a deterministic state snapshot, fires a seven-question judgment battery at TypeSafe's Jev decision model (the Vercel AI Gateway is the normal route, a direct TypeSafe key is a faster optional extra, or a labelled mock), composes an action from your own strategy.py thresholds, prices with Avellaneda-Stoikov, checks nine hard risk limits, and executes on Alpaca paper by default. Live trading exists behind a deliberately awkward three-gate opt-in, off unless all three are set. Includes a live HTML dashboard and a calibration report.
---

# jev-loop

Install location: `~/.claude/skills/jev-loop/`.
Framework: Roan (@RohOnChain), "How to Use Jev to Build a 24/7 HFT Trading System". Installed as a Claude Code skill by Lewis Jackson.

## The split

Deterministic layer (your code): exact arithmetic (mid-price, spread, book
imbalance), hard metrics (inventory, drawdown, session VWAP), safety and
policy (stop-losses, risk vetoes, routing orders to the book).

Probabilistic layer (Jev): fuzzy conditions (trending, mean reverting,
chaotic), order quality (is flow toxic or noise), execution health (is
the setup optimal or degrading). Seven typed questions, one call, one
latency, none of them arithmetic and none of them "what should I do."

```
uv run python -m jevloop explain-split
```

prints the full two-column table with the file that owns each row.

## Invocation

Natural language, or directly:

```
cd ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop
uv run python -m jevloop run --paper --ticks 60 --symbol BTC/USD
uv run python -m jevloop run --paper --mock            # force the mock client (never places orders)
uv run python -m jevloop run --paper --dry-execution   # real data and a real battery, no orders sent
uv run python -m jevloop run --paper --forever         # run continuously, Ctrl+C or `kill <pid>` to stop
uv run python -m jevloop run --paper --forever --bar 30m  # one decision per 30-minute bar close (1m/5m/15m/30m/1h)
uv run python -m jevloop validate-symbol AAPL          # resolve any symbol before running on it
uv run python -m jevloop explain-split                 # the deterministic vs probabilistic table
uv run python -m jevloop calibrate                     # Brier score + reliability table
uv run python -m jevloop serve                         # dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

`--ticks 0` means the same thing as `--forever`. Both cancel the resting
orders this run placed (and nothing else on the account) before exiting.

Ask Claude things like:

- "run the jev-loop skill for 100 ticks on ETH/USD"
- "run jev-loop on AAPL and tell me if the market's open"
- "run jev-loop in mock mode so I can see the dashboard without spending a key"
- "keep jev-loop running continuously in the background"
- "calibrate the jev-loop and show me the Brier score"
- "explain the split in jev-loop"

## Any asset

`--symbol` accepts any crypto pair (`BTC/USD`, `ETH/USD`, 24/7) or any US
equity ticker (`AAPL`, `SPY`, `TSLA`, `NVDA`, market hours only). The
default stays `BTC/USD` because it never closes. `jevloop/assets.py`
resolves the symbol into a spec: which Alpaca endpoints to call, the
minimum order notional, quantity precision, whether shorting is allowed,
and whether the venue is open right now. Orders are sized from a dollar
target (`notional_usd` in `limits.py`), not a fixed quantity, so the same
config works whether the asset is an $85,000 coin or a $30 stock.

Equities have no Level 2 depth on the basic feed: the state snapshot uses
best bid/ask and recent trades only, and marks the missing depth fields
absent rather than inventing them. When the equity market is closed, the
loop holds and never places an order; it says so on the tick line rather
than silently doing nothing.

## Your strategy lives in strategy.py

Everything this loop ships with is a harness, not an edge: a generic
strategy pulled out of thin air, wired in only so a demo run shows real
fills. `jevloop/strategy.py` is the one file built for you to edit --
it owns the seven tunable thresholds `compose_action()` reads (when to
pull quotes, widen, quote both sides or wide, and how confident Jev has
to be before a directional leg is taken), plus an `apply_strategy()` hook
called on every tick with the action already chosen, free to change it
or veto it outright. The shipped default matches exactly what the video
ran: change nothing here and nothing changes. The hard risk caps stay
separate, in `jevloop/limits.py`, and a strategy can never raise them,
only add more caution on top.

## What each file does

| File | Job |
|---|---|
| `jevloop/strategy.py` | The file you edit: the seven tunable thresholds behind `compose_action()`, plus the `apply_strategy()` hook to override or veto an action. Shipped default changes nothing. |
| `jevloop/limits.py` | The hard risk caps and operational numbers. Never overridable by a strategy. |
| `jevloop/assets.py` | Resolves any symbol into a spec: endpoints, notional floor, precision, shorting, market hours. |
| `jevloop/state.py` | Deterministic state snapshot, under ~400 tokens, real price history with the venue's own timestamps (one-minute bars backfilled at startup plus a mid sample every tick), each trade counted once in session VWAP, drawdown measured against real account equity, honest depth degradation. |
| `jevloop/split.py` | The allow-list of battery questions and the guard that refuses any question that looks like arithmetic. |
| `jevloop/battery.py` | The seven-question Jev battery (regime, direction, toxic flow, liquidity stress, quote environment, inventory pressure, execution health). |
| `jevloop/client.py` | Resolves the decision client: Vercel AI Gateway (the normal route) or a direct TypeSafe key (a faster optional extra) or a mock, prints which one won, pins and logs the model per response. |
| `jevloop/policy.py` | `compose_action()`, code, not Jev, turns seven answers into KILL / PULL_QUOTES / WIDEN / QUOTE_BOTH_SIDES / QUOTE_WIDE / STAND_DOWN using strategy.py's thresholds, plus a directional leg, then hands the result to strategy.py's hook. |
| `jevloop/pricing.py` | Avellaneda-Stoikov reservation price and half spread. |
| `jevloop/risk.py` | Nine hard limits, checked before every order, never delegated. |
| `jevloop/ladder.py` | The five-rung fallback ladder (RUN / REDUCE / HOLD_LATE / RULES_ONLY / KILL). |
| `jevloop/execution/alpaca.py` | Alpaca execution, crypto or equities. Paper by default; live trading exists only behind the three-gate opt-in (see Live trading below). Refuses to place an equity order while the market is closed. |
| `jevloop/loop.py` | The nine-stage block loop, one JSON line per tick to `~/.jev-loop/log.jsonl` and `~/.jev-loop/latest.json`. Supports `--forever` / `--ticks 0` with a clean shutdown that cancels only this run's resting orders. Fills are read back from Alpaca, never assumed; KILL sends a real closing order. |
| `jevloop/calibrate.py` | Brier score + 10-bin reliability table from the log, scoring Jev's confidence in each up/down call against whether price moved that way; `reliability.png` if matplotlib is present. |
| `jevloop/serve.py` | Tiny static server for `dashboard/index.html` and `dashboard/wall.html`. |
| `dashboard/*.html` | Two live dashboards, polling `latest.json`. No simulation. |
| `tests/` | pytest for policy thresholds, risk vetoes, the ladder, state maths, the asset resolver, the split guard, the mock client's shape, the Alpaca paper-URL guard, and the three-gate live-trading check. |

## Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in this folder and fill in what you have.
2. `ALPACA_API_KEY` / `ALPACA_SECRET_KEY` are required, paper keys only,
   from https://app.alpaca.markets/paper/dashboard/overview. Paper keys
   start with `PK`.
3. `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` is the normal way to reach Jev: works today, no
   invite or waitlist, but the Vercel team needs a card on file before
   the gateway will serve requests, even the free credits. A few dollars
   covers roughly a month at this tick rate. `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` is an
   optional extra, slightly faster (one less hop), useful only if you are
   already off TypeSafe's waitlist. Without either, the loop runs on a
   clearly-labelled mock decision client so nothing above blocks on a
   billing page or a waitlist. Mock runs are always dry: no orders.
4. `DEFAULT_SYMBOL` is optional; it sets what `--symbol` defaults to if
   you don't pass one.

## Live trading (opt-in, off by default)

Paper is the default everywhere in this skill. Turning on live trading
needs all three of the following, together, every time:

1. the `--live` flag on the command line
2. `JEV_LOOP_ALLOW_LIVE=i-understand-the-risk` in the environment
3. typing the exact confirmation phrase the CLI asks for at startup

Missing any one of the three refuses to start; it never falls back to
paper silently. All three present routes every order to Alpaca's live
endpoint instead of paper, with real money and no safety net beyond the
risk caps in `limits.py`, which still apply and are not raised by going
live. This is the "flip of a switch" the video describes, made
deliberately awkward on purpose so it only ever happens on purpose. See
README.md for the exact commands.

## Dependencies

`uv`-managed virtual environment under `.venv/` with Python 3.10+ and:

- `requests>=2.31`
- `python-dotenv>=1.0`
- `matplotlib>=3.8` (optional, only for `reliability.png`)
- `pytest>=8.0` (dev only, for `tests/`)

## What this is not

Paper by default, everywhere. Live trading exists only behind the
three-gate opt-in above and starts with the same small dollar caps as
paper. This does not claim a profit. It cannot turn a bad strategy into
a good one: Jev makes seven judgments cheap and fast, edge is still
yours, and yours lives in strategy.py.

# jev-loop

A 24/7 paper-trading loop built around a Jev decision battery, for the video
*How to Use Jev to Build a 24/7 HFT Trading System*.

The split, in one sentence: code computes the state, Jev answers seven typed
questions about it in one call, your code composes those answers into an
action using thresholds you set in `strategy.py`, a risk engine can veto
any of it, and execution defaults to Alpaca's paper API everywhere.

## Quick start

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop
cp .env.example .env        # fill in ALPACA_API_KEY / ALPACA_SECRET_KEY at minimum
uv run pytest -q             # tests, no network needed
uv run python -m jevloop explain-split         # the split, as a table
uv run python -m jevloop validate-symbol AAPL  # resolve any symbol first

```

`--symbol` takes any crypto pair (24/7) or US equity ticker (market hours
only); `jevloop/assets.py` resolves it into endpoints, order-size rules,
and session rules. Orders are sized from a dollar target, not a fixed
quantity, so the same defaults work across assets.

No `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` or `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`? The loop runs on a
clearly-labelled mock decision client. It says so on the first line. The
mock answers with random numbers, so it never places orders, not even on
paper: a mock run is always a dry run.

## Running continuously

A plain run stops after `--ticks N`. To keep it going:

```bash
uv run python -m jevloop run --paper --forever --symbol BTC/USD
# or, equivalently:
uv run python -m jevloop run --paper --ticks 0 --symbol BTC/USD
```

Add `--bar 30m` (or `1m`, `5m`, `15m`, `1h`) to decide once per bar close,
UTC-aligned, instead of every 2 s. Returns and volatility still come from
real one-minute bars, refreshed at each close.

Stop it with Ctrl+C in the foreground. In the background:

```bash
nohup uv run python -m jevloop run --paper --forever --symbol BTC/USD \
  > ~/.jev-loop/continuous.log 2>&1 &
echo $! > ~/.jev-loop/continuous.pid
# ...later...
kill "$(cat ~/.jev-loop/continuous.pid)"
```

On Windows PowerShell there is no `nohup` or `kill`, and `jevloop` needs
the keys from `.env` loaded by uv. Run it in its own minimised window and
stop it with Ctrl+C in that window (a `Stop-Process` is a hard stop that
skips the order clean-up below):

```powershell
Start-Process powershell -WindowStyle Minimized -WorkingDirectory "$HOME\.claude\skills\jev-loop" -ArgumentList "-NoExit", "-Command", "uv run --env-file .env python -m jevloop run --paper --forever"
```

Either way, on Ctrl+C or `kill` the loop cancels the resting orders it
placed itself before it exits rather than leaving them open. It never
touches other orders on your Alpaca account. The dashboard (`jevloop
serve`) keeps reading the same `~/.jev-loop/latest.json` regardless of
whether the run is bounded or continuous.

## Your strategy lives in strategy.py

Everything this loop ships with is a harness, not an edge: a generic
strategy pulled out of thin air, wired in only so a demo run shows real
fills. `jevloop/strategy.py` owns the seven tunable thresholds behind
`compose_action()` and an `apply_strategy()` hook that gets one last
look at every action before it goes near an order, free to change or
veto it. The shipped default matches exactly what the video ran.

## The nine-stage loop

```
block event -> read the book -> state snapshot -> battery (seven Jev judgments)
  -> policy engine (strategy.py's thresholds + hook) -> pricing (Avellaneda-Stoikov, your code)
  -> risk veto (your code, absolute) -> post-only quotes + directional leg
  -> log, fills, inventory
```

## The fallback ladder

```
healthy + high confidence -> RUN
healthy + low confidence  -> REDUCE
late past the tick budget -> HOLD_LATE (never quote on stale state)
Jev unavailable            -> RULES_ONLY (deterministic fallback, no model)
hard limit breached        -> KILL (cancel own orders, market-close the position it built, stop)
```

## Live trading (opt-in, off by default)

Paper is the default everywhere: `execution/alpaca.py` will not reach
Alpaca's live endpoint unless all three of the following are true at
once.

```bash
export JEV_LOOP_ALLOW_LIVE=i-understand-the-risk
uv run python -m jevloop run --live --ticks 30 --symbol BTC/USD
# then type the exact confirmation phrase the CLI prints and asks for
```

Windows PowerShell sets the variable with
`$env:JEV_LOOP_ALLOW_LIVE = "i-understand-the-risk"` and runs
`uv run --env-file .env python -m jevloop run --live --ticks 30 --symbol BTC/USD`.

Missing the environment variable, missing `--live`, or typing anything
other than the exact confirmation phrase refuses to start; it never
falls back to paper silently. This is real money with no paper safety
net, at the same small dollar caps `limits.py` enforces on paper -- a
strategy can never raise them. Treat `--live` as what it is: a flip of
a switch made deliberately awkward so it only ever happens on purpose.

## Safety

- Paper by default, everywhere. Live trading exists only behind the
  three-gate opt-in above.
- The hard risk caps live in `jevloop/limits.py` and never change between
  paper and live. The tunable strategy thresholds live in `jevloop/strategy.py`
  instead -- change a number, restart, see different behaviour.
- The risk engine (`jevloop/risk.py`) never calls Jev and never delegates,
  and runs after `strategy.py`'s hook has had its say, not before.
- Long or flat only. Alpaca crypto is spot and this account can't short,
  so a SELL signal closes the long this run holds (never more than Alpaca
  says is held) and does nothing when flat ("no position to close").
- This is not investment advice and it does not claim a profit. It is a
  scaffold for a decision battery, a policy engine, and a risk layer around
  a fast model. Edge is still your job, and it lives in `strategy.py`.

One call, one latency, seven typed answers. Every question is atomic and

limits.py. The seven questions implement the three probabilistic rows in
the split (see split.py): fuzzy market conditions (regime, direction),
order quality (toxic_flow, liquidity_stressed), and execution health
(quote_environment, inventory_pressure, execution_health).

Question shape follows the verified TypeSafe / Vercel AI Gateway request
schema (see reference/systemone-request-shape.json):
  - noul needs only "instructions"
  - choice.criteria is a map of option -> description (or null)
  - score.criteria is an ARRAY of level descriptions, ordered low to high

Every question dict built here is checked against jevloop/split.py before

This is the harness the video talks about, not the edge. Everything it
shipped with is a generic strategy pulled out of thin air, wired in only
so the demo has something to trade. Real strategies are hard to build
properly; this file is where yours goes.

Two things live here:

1. `StrategyThresholds`, one number per action in `compose_action()`
   (policy.py): when to pull quotes, when to widen, when the quote
   environment is good enough to quote both sides or just quote wide, how
   much inventory pressure skews sizing, and how confident Jev has to be
   about direction before a directional leg is taken. Change a number,
   restart the loop, see different behaviour on the next tick.

2. `apply_strategy()`, a hook called once per tick with the action
   `compose_action()` already produced from the thresholds above. Return
   it unchanged (the default) and nothing changes from what shipped in
   the video. Return a different action to override it, or an action
   with `kind=STAND_DOWN` to veto the tick outright. This is the one
   function a real strategy plugs into.

Shipped default: every threshold below matches what the video ran, and
`apply_strategy()` is a no-op. Nothing changes for someone who never
opens this file.

The hard risk caps (max position, max daily loss, max drawdown, and so
on) do NOT live here: they live in `jevloop/limits.py`, checked in
`risk.py` before every order, and this file cannot raise them. A
strategy can make the loop more conservative than the risk engine
allows; it can never make it less conservative than the risk engine
allows.

Paper by default. `--mock` forces the mock decision client even if a real
key is present, useful for a clean demo run that can never fail on network
or billing grounds. A mock answers with random numbers, so any mock run
(forced, or fallen back to mid-run) is also a dry run: no orders at all. `--dry-execution` reads real market data and fires a
real Jev battery but never submits an order to Alpaca; every fill line
reads "dry" instead. Useful for testing the full pipeline without touching
the paper account. `--ticks 0` or `--forever` runs continuously until
stopped (Ctrl+C, or a SIGTERM if it is running in the background), and
cancels the resting orders it placed (only those, matched on this run's
client_order_id prefix) before it exits rather than leaving them behind. `--live` is a separate, deliberately awkward opt-in documented in
execution/alpaca.py and SKILL.md; paper is what every default here
resolves to unless a caller goes out of its way to ask for live.

Any asset `jevloop/assets.py` resolves: a crypto pair runs 24/7; a US
equity ticker only trades while the market is open, and the loop holds
(never orders) while it is closed, per `execution/alpaca.py`'s market-hours
guard.

### 2.3: Pin Python and create the virtual environment

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop
uv python install 3.12
uv venv --python 3.12 .venv
```

These three lines are the same on Windows (PowerShell and Git Bash both accept `cd ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop`; in cmd use `cd /d "%USERPROFILE%\.claude\skills\jev-loop"`). The venv lands in `.venv\Scripts` on Windows and `.venv/bin` on Mac / Linux. You don't need to activate it; `uv run` uses it.

Verify:
```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop && uv run python --version
```
Expect `Python 3.12.x`. If `uv python install 3.12` fails (rare, Astral's mirror briefly unreachable), retry once after 60 seconds. If it still fails, surface the exact `uv` stderr and ask the user to retry the prompt.

---

## Phase 3: Installation and self-test

### 3.1: Install dependencies

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This installs `requests`, `python-dotenv`, and `pytest`. If it fails, surface the exact `uv` stderr and stop, the common cause is no network. The idempotency in Phase 1.2 makes a re-run safe.

### 3.2: Run the test suite

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop
uv run pytest -q
```

Expect all tests to pass (105 at the time this prompt was written; more may exist if this file has been updated since). These tests need no network and no keys, they cover the policy thresholds, the risk vetoes, the fallback ladder, the state snapshot's maths and token budget, the asset resolver, the notional order-sizing floor, the closed-market guard, the split guard, the mock decision client's shape, the Alpaca paper-URL guard, the three-gate live-trading check, and the fixes for bugs members reported (the Windows file lock on latest.json, real price history, VWAP counted once, drawdown against real equity, fills read back from Alpaca, KILL sending a real closing order, cancelling only this run's orders, calibration on the direction confidence, mock runs never ordering, a SELL closing the long and never opening a short, and `--bar` deciding once per bar close). If anything fails, surface the failure and stop; do not continue to Phase 4 with a broken scaffold.

### 3.3: Create the working `.env`

```bash
cp ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop/.env.example ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop/.env
```

Windows PowerShell: `Copy-Item "$HOME\.claude\skills\jev-loop\.env.example" "$HOME\.claude\skills\jev-loop\.env"`. Git Bash runs the `cp` line as written.

Print: `Created ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop/.env from the template. I'll open it for you at each step below.`

---

## Phase 4: Alpaca paper key (required)

The loop cannot run without a working Alpaca **paper** key. This is not optional: it is the only execution venue this install ever touches, paper by default, never live trading during this walkthrough.

1. Say: "Now I need an Alpaca paper trading key. This usually takes 2 to 5 minutes depending on whether you already have an account, and there's no cost, paper trading is free and never touches real money."
2. Open the Alpaca paper dashboard:
   - **Mac:** `open https://app.alpaca.markets/paper/dashboard/overview`
   - **Linux:** `xdg-open https://app.alpaca.markets/paper/dashboard/overview`
   - **Windows, PowerShell:** `Start-Process "https://app.alpaca.markets/paper/dashboard/overview"`
   - **Windows, Git Bash:** `cmd //c start "" "https://app.alpaca.markets/paper/dashboard/overview"`
3. Say: "Sign in or sign up if you need to. On the paper dashboard, look in the left sidebar for **Your API Keys**, then click **Generate New Keys**. Copy both the Key ID and the Secret, the secret is only shown once."
4. Open `.env` in their editor:
   - **Mac:** `open -e ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop/.env`
   - **Linux:** `${EDITOR:-nano} ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop/.env` (or `xdg-open` if that opens a GUI text editor on their system)
   - **Windows, PowerShell:** `notepad "$HOME\.claude\skills\jev-loop\.env"`
   - **Windows, Git Bash:** `notepad "$(cygpath -w ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop/.env)"`
5. Say: "Paste the Key ID after `ALPACA_API_KEY=` and the Secret after `ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=`, save, and tell me when you're done."
6. Wait for the user to confirm.
7. Verify with a real call:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop
set -a; source .env; set +a
curl -s -w "\nHTTP_STATUS:%{http_code}\n" https://paper-api.alpaca.markets/v2/account \
  -H "APCA-API-KEY-ID: $ALPACA_API_KEY" -H "APCA-API-SECRET-KEY: $ALPACA_SECRET_KEY"
```

   On Windows, don't `source` the file. In Git Bash, strip Notepad's line endings as you load it:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop
set -a; source <(tr -d '\r' < .env); set +a
curl -s -w "\nHTTP_STATUS:%{http_code}\n" https://paper-api.alpaca.markets/v2/account \
  -H "APCA-API-KEY-ID: $ALPACA_API_KEY" -H "APCA-API-SECRET-KEY: $ALPACA_SECRET_KEY"
```

   In PowerShell, read the keys out of `.env` and call `curl.exe` (not `curl`):

```powershell
cd ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop
Get-Content .env | ForEach-Object {
  if ($_ -match '^\s*([A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*)\s*=\s*(.*)$') {
    Set-Item -Path "env:$($Matches[1])" -Value $Matches[2].Trim().Trim('"').Trim("'")
  }
}
curl.exe -s -w "\nHTTP_STATUS:%{http_code}\n" https://paper-api.alpaca.markets/v2/account -H "APCA-API-KEY-ID: $env:ALPACA_API_KEY" -H "APCA-API-SECRET-KEY: $env:ALPACA_SECRET_KEY"
```

8. **On `HTTP_STATUS:200`:** parse the JSON, print `✓ Alpaca paper account verified, cash $<cash>, status <status>.` and continue to Phase 5.

9. **On `HTTP_STATUS:401`, or any other non-200 status: do not abort.** This almost always means one of: the key was copied from the **live** dashboard instead of the **paper** one (a paper key starts with `PK`), a character got clipped during paste, or the key was regenerated since. Handle it the same way every time, as many times as it takes:
   - Print exactly: "That key didn't verify (HTTP `<status>`). This is usually the live-dashboard key instead of the paper one, or a copy-paste slip. Let's try again, I'll reopen both pages."
   - Re-open the paper dashboard (step 2) and re-open `.env` (step 4).
   - Say: "Double check you're on `app.alpaca.markets/paper/dashboard/overview` (the URL must say `paper`), regenerate the key if you're not sure, paste both values again, save, and tell me when you're done."
   - Wait, then re-run the verification curl in step 7.
   - Repeat as many times as needed. Never move on with an unverified key, and never tell the user to give up.

---

## Phase 5: Jev decision model (the normal route works today, no waitlist)

Jev is optional. Without a working key here the loop runs on a clearly-labelled mock decision client, plausible, persistent, never presented as real, so nothing above is blocked by this step.

1. Say: "Now, optionally, a key for Jev, the decision model. The normal route is a Vercel AI Gateway key: it works today, no invite and no waitlist. One thing before we go there: Vercel needs a card on the team on file before the gateway will serve requests, even the free starting credits, so add one if the team doesn't have one yet. At this tick rate, a few dollars covers roughly a month. If you already have a direct TypeSafe key from being off their waitlist, that's a faster optional extra, one less network hop, but nobody needs it to follow along today. If you don't want to set up either right now, say so and I'll run everything on the mock. The loop and the dashboard both work fully on it."
2. For the normal route: open `https://vercel.com/dashboard` with the open command for this OS and shell from step 1.1 (`open`, `xdg-open`, `Start-Process` in PowerShell, `cmd //c start ""` in Git Bash) and say: "Pick your team, then in the left sidebar go to **AI Gateway**, then **API keys**, then create a key. If the team doesn't have a card on file yet, that's the one prerequisite: add it first under the team's billing settings, then come back and create the key."
3. If they mention they already have a direct TypeSafe key: say: "Paste that in when we get to the `.env` file instead, it skips the gateway's one extra hop." No need to open typesafe.ai or discuss the waitlist, this is only relevant to someone already past it.
4. Re-open `.env` (same command as Phase 4 step 4) and say: "Paste it after `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=` for the normal route, or `TYPESAFE_API_KEY=` if you already have a direct key. Save, and tell me when you're done. Or tell me to skip this and I'll run on the mock."
5. Wait for the user to confirm, or to say skip.
6. **If they skip:** print `Running on the mock decision client, no AI Gateway or TypeSafe key set. Mock runs are dry: real market data, no orders. You can add one later and re-run any jev-loop command.` and go to Phase 6.
7. **Otherwise, verify with one real decision call:**

    answers, meta = run_battery(client, snap, timeout=5.0)
    print(f'model={meta[\"model\"]} route={meta[\"route\"]} latency_ms={meta[\"latency_ms\"]}')
    for k, v in answers.items():
        print(f'  {k}: {v}')
except GatewayVerificationRequired as exc:
    print(f'GATEWAY_403: {exc}')
"
```

   On Windows (PowerShell or Git Bash) the quoting in that one-liner breaks. Instead, write the same Python code to a file `verify_jev.py` in `~/.claude/skills/jev-loop/`, with every `\"` changed to a plain `"`, then run it with the keys loaded from `.env`, then delete the file:

```powershell
cd ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop
uv run --env-file .env python verify_jev.py
Remove-Item verify_jev.py
```

   (Git Bash: the same `uv run --env-file .env python verify_jev.py`, then `rm verify_jev.py`.)

8. **On success:** print the seven answers, the latency, and the model exactly as the script prints them, then say one line naming the route used (the gateway, or a direct key, and that the gateway adds one hop) and continue to Phase 6.

9. **On `GATEWAY_403` (customer_verification_required):** print exactly: "The Vercel AI Gateway needs a card on file before it will serve requests. Add one at https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fai%3Fmodal%3Dadd-credit-card, then re-run this verification. For now I'm continuing on the mock decision client so nothing is blocked." Then continue to Phase 6 on the mock. Do not treat this as a fatal error.

10. **On any other error** (bad key, network): print the exact error, offer to re-open `.env` and retry once, and if it still fails say: "I'll continue on the mock decision client. You can fix the key later and every `jev-loop` command will pick it up automatically."

---

## Phase 6: Choose an asset

1. If the user already picked a supported asset in Phase 0.1, use it and skip to step 3. Otherwise say in one line: "Two options: any crypto pair, which runs 24/7 (like BTC/USD, ETH/USD, or PAXG/USD for gold), or any US stock or ETF, which only trades during market hours (like AAPL, SPY, GLD, NVDA). Which do you want to watch, or say nothing and I'll default to BTC/USD since it never closes."
2. Wait for their answer. If they say nothing or say "default", use `BTC/USD`.
3. Validate whatever they typed:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop
uv run python -m jevloop validate-symbol "<THEIR_SYMBOL>"
```

4. **On success:** print the resolved spec exactly as the command prints it (asset class, session, minimum order size, precision, shorting, depth). Say one sentence plain-English translation, for example: "AAPL resolved, a US stock, so the loop only trades while the market is open and the risk limits scale to a per-share price instead of a coin price."
5. **On failure** (`UnknownSymbolError`, printed as a plain message naming valid forms): say the message back in one sentence, then re-ask step 1. Never guess a symbol on the user's behalf.
6. Open `.env` (same command as Phase 4 step 4) and say: "I'm setting `DEFAULT_SYMBOL` to `<resolved symbol>` so every command defaults to it. Save if you want to change it later." Then write or update the `DEFAULT_SYMBOL=` line in `.env` yourself (do not require the user to type it):

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop
python3 - <<'PYEOF'
import pathlib
p = pathlib.Path(".env")
lines = [l for l in p.read_text().splitlines() if not l.startswith("DEFAULT_SYMBOL=")]
lines.append("DEFAULT_SYMBOL=<RESOLVED_SYMBOL>")
p.write_text("\n".join(lines) + "\n")
PYEOF
```

On Windows, `python3` and the `<<'PYEOF'` heredoc are the problem. Git Bash keeps the heredoc but swaps `python3 -` for `uv run python -`. PowerShell pipes the same code in:

```powershell
cd ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop
@'
import pathlib
p = pathlib.Path(".env")
lines = [l for l in p.read_text().splitlines() if not l.startswith("DEFAULT_SYMBOL=")]
lines.append("DEFAULT_SYMBOL=<RESOLVED_SYMBOL>")
p.write_text("\n".join(lines) + "\n")
'@ | uv run python -
```

Replace `<RESOLVED_SYMBOL>` with the actual resolved symbol before running this. Confirm by printing the line back from `.env`.

7. If the resolved asset is a US equity, mention once: "Since the market can be closed, the demo run in a few minutes might just show HOLD lines if it's outside market hours right now, that's the loop refusing to trade on a frozen price, not a bug. Crypto never has that problem."

---

## Phase 7: First run: 30 ticks in paper mode

Run the loop so the user sees it work. This is the load-bearing demo moment. Use the symbol resolved and saved in Phase 6 (read `DEFAULT_SYMBOL` from `.env`, or pass `--symbol` explicitly with that value):

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop
set -a; source .env; set +a
uv run python -m jevloop run --paper --ticks 30 --symbol "$DEFAULT_SYMBOL"
```

On Windows (PowerShell or Git Bash), let uv load `.env`. `--symbol` then defaults to `DEFAULT_SYMBOL` from the file, so leave it off:

```powershell
cd ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop
uv run --env-file .env python -m jevloop run --paper --ticks 30
```

If the user asked for a bar timeframe in Phase 0.1 (e.g. 30m), still do this first 30-tick run on the default 2-second cadence so they see it work in a minute, not fifteen hours. Then, for the continuous run below, add `--bar 30m` (or their timeframe). In bar mode each tick is one bar close, so 30 ticks of `--bar 30m` takes 15 hours.

Let the tick lines print to the terminal as they happen, one line per tick, e.g.:

```
tick 41 | mid 85,808.2 | regime mean_reverting 86% | tox 0.36 | env 2.1 | xh 2.6 | 370 ms | QUOTE_WIDE skew +0.0 | filled buy 0.0001 @ 85,807.90
```

If a tick shows `late` or `HOLD (late)`, that is the block-deadline rule working as designed. Say so in one sentence and do not treat it as an error. If a tick shows `market is closed`, that is the equity market-hours guard: it is expected outside trading hours and never places an order. If a tick shows `order error`, that is a real Alpaca-side rejection (for example a minimum-notional or short-selling rule on a two-sided quote) being caught and logged rather than crashing the loop. Say so in one sentence if it comes up, and keep going: the loop is designed to survive individual order rejections.

When it finishes:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop
uv run python -m jevloop serve --port 8765 &
```

On Windows, Git Bash can use the same `&` line (or your own run-in-background feature). In PowerShell, `&` at the end of a line doesn't background anything; start it as its own process instead:

```powershell
Start-Process uv -ArgumentList "run", "python", "-m", "jevloop", "serve", "--port", "8765" -WorkingDirectory "$HOME\.claude\skills\jev-loop" -WindowStyle Hidden -PassThru
```

Note the `Id` it prints; `Stop-Process -Id <Id>` stops the dashboard server later.

Wait one second, then open the dashboard:

- **Mac:** `open http://127.0.0.1:8765/index.html`
- **Linux:** `xdg-open http://127.0.0.1:8765/index.html`
- **Windows, PowerShell:** `Start-Process "http://127.0.0.1:8765/index.html"`
- **Windows, Git Bash:** `cmd //c start "" "http://127.0.0.1:8765/index.html"`

Say: "That's the live dashboard, reading the real log from the run that just finished, nothing on it is simulated. There's a dark variant too at `/wall.html` if you want it for a different look." If port 8765 is already taken on this machine, retry once on 8899 and use that port in both commands above.

Then ask once: "Want me to keep this running continuously in the background instead of stopping at 30 ticks? It'll keep trading paper until you stop it." Wait for a yes or no.

**If no:** say "Understood, it stays stopped at the 30-tick run above. You can start it again any time with `jev-loop run --paper --forever`." and continue to Phase 8.

**If yes:** start it unbounded, in the background, on the same symbol. If they asked for a bar timeframe, add `--bar <timeframe>` (e.g. `--bar 30m`) to the run command, on every OS:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop
set -a; source .env; set +a
mkdir -p ~/.jev-loop
nohup uv run python -m jevloop run --paper --forever --symbol "$DEFAULT_SYMBOL" \
  > ~/.jev-loop/continuous.log 2>&1 &
echo $! > ~/.jev-loop/continuous.pid
```

Confirm it is actually running (`cat ~/.jev-loop/continuous.pid`, then check the process exists), then say: "It's running continuously in the background now, paper only. The dashboard you already have open keeps reading it live. To stop it: `kill $(cat ~/.jev-loop/continuous.pid)`, that's a clean shutdown, it cancels the resting orders it placed (nothing else on your account) before it exits. Its own output is logged at `~/.jev-loop/continuous.log` if you want to check on it later." Then continue to Phase 8.

**On Windows**, `nohup` and `kill` are the parts that change, and the stop matters: the loop's clean shutdown (cancelling the orders it placed) runs on Ctrl+C. A forced kill on Windows skips it.

- **Git Bash:** the same `cd`, `mkdir -p` and `echo $!` lines, but start it without `nohup` and with uv loading `.env`:

  ```bash
  cd ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop
  mkdir -p ~/.jev-loop
  uv run --env-file .env python -m jevloop run --paper --forever > ~/.jev-loop/continuous.log 2>&1 &
  echo $! > ~/.jev-loop/continuous.pid
  ```

- **PowerShell:** open it in its own minimised window, so there is a window to press Ctrl+C in later:

  ```powershell
  New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$HOME\.jev-loop" | Out-Null
  $p = Start-Process powershell -WindowStyle Minimized -WorkingDirectory "$HOME\.claude\skills\jev-loop" -ArgumentList "-NoExit", "-Command", "uv run --env-file .env python -m jevloop run --paper --forever" -PassThru
  $p.Id | Set-Content "$HOME\.jev-loop\continuous.pid"
  ```

  Check it's alive with `Get-Process -Id (Get-Content "$HOME\.jev-loop\continuous.pid")`. The ticks print in that window and log to `~/.jev-loop/log.jsonl`.

On Windows, replace the stop instruction you give the user with: "To stop it cleanly, open the minimised jev-loop window from the taskbar and press Ctrl+C. That cancels the resting orders it placed (nothing else on your account) before it exits. `Stop-Process -Id (Get-Content $HOME\.jev-loop\continuous.pid)` also stops it, but it's a hard stop, so check the Alpaca paper dashboard for any jev-loop orders still open and cancel them there." (Git Bash: `kill $(cat ~/.jev-loop/continuous.pid)` is also a hard stop on Windows, same caveat.)

## Phase 8: Confirmation and how to use it

First, print the split table again, this time with file names, by running it rather than retyping it:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop
uv run python -m jevloop explain-split
```

Print its output exactly as it prints. Then print a final summary. Match this format and wording:

```
================================================================
 ✓ jev-loop skill installed at ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop/

 Installed:
   • Any asset (assets.py): <RESOLVED_SYMBOL> resolved as <crypto | a US
     equity>, <24/7 | market hours only>
   • Deterministic state engine (state.py), under ~400 tokens, strict
     timestamp discipline, session VWAP, honest depth degradation
   • The split, enforced (split.py): every battery question is checked
     against an allow-list and refused if it looks like arithmetic
   • Seven-question Jev battery (battery.py): regime, direction, toxic
     flow, liquidity stress, quote environment, inventory pressure,
     execution health
   • Decision client: <Vercel AI Gateway | TypeSafe direct | MOCK>
   • Your strategy lives in strategy.py: seven tunable thresholds behind
     compose_action(), plus a hook to override or veto any action.
     Shipped default changes nothing until you edit it
   • Avellaneda-Stoikov pricing (pricing.py), code, never the model
   • Risk engine (risk.py): nine hard limits in dollars, checked before
     every order, never raised by a strategy or by going live
   • Fallback ladder (ladder.py): RUN / REDUCE / HOLD_LATE / RULES_ONLY / KILL
   • Alpaca execution (execution/alpaca.py), paper by default; live
     trading exists only behind a deliberately awkward three-gate
     opt-in (--live, an environment variable, and a typed confirmation,
     all three), and refuses to trade a closed equity market either way
   • Live dashboard at dashboard/index.html and dashboard/wall.html
   • A full test suite, all passing, no network required

 First run: 30 ticks in paper mode on <RESOLVED_SYMBOL>, complete.
 <Now running continuously in the background, PID <PID>, stop with
 `kill <PID>` (Windows: Ctrl+C in its window) | Stopped after the 30-tick run, restart any time with
 `jev-loop run --paper --forever`.> Dashboard open.

 You can now ask Claude, in any Claude Code session, to:
   • run the jev-loop skill for 100 ticks on ETH/USD
   • run jev-loop on AAPL and tell me if the market's open
   • run jev-loop in mock mode so you can see the dashboard without a key
   • keep jev-loop running continuously in the background
   • calibrate the jev-loop and show me the Brier score
   • explain the split in jev-loop

 Or run it directly:
   cd ~/.claude/skills/jev-loop
   uv run python -m jevloop run --paper --ticks 200 --symbol BTC/USD
   uv run python -m jevloop run --paper --forever --symbol BTC/USD
   uv run python -m jevloop validate-symbol AAPL
   uv run python -m jevloop explain-split
   uv run python -m jevloop calibrate
   uv run python -m jevloop serve

 Your strategy's tunable thresholds are in jevloop/strategy.py, the file
 built for you to edit, alongside a hook that can override or veto any
 action. The hard risk caps stay separate, in jevloop/limits.py, and a
 strategy can never raise them. Change a number, restart the loop, see
 different behaviour, no prompt to edit, no model to retrain.

 Framework: Roan (@RohOnChain), original article author.
 Installed as a Claude Code skill by Lewis Jackson.

 Paper by default, everywhere. Live trading exists only behind the
 three-gate opt-in documented in SKILL.md and README.md. This does not
 claim a profit and it is not investment advice. Jev makes seven
 judgments cheap and fast, edge is still yours, and it lives in
 strategy.py.
================================================================
```

Fill in the decision-client line with whichever of Vercel AI Gateway / TypeSafe direct / MOCK actually won in Phase 5, `<RESOLVED_SYMBOL>` with whatever was resolved and saved in Phase 6, and the continuous-run line with whichever branch of Phase 7's question actually happened (including the real PID if it is running in the background). On Windows, write the "Or run it directly" lines as `uv run --env-file .env python -m jevloop ...` so the keys in `.env` are loaded.

End. Do not continue past Phase 8. Do not suggest next steps the user did not ask for.

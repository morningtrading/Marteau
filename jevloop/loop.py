"""The nine-stage block loop.

    1. block event            (tick clock, "block" = one tick, default 2s)
    2. read the book          (Alpaca paper market data: L2 depth on crypto,
                               best bid/ask on equities, and recent trades)
    3. state snapshot         (deterministic, state.py)
    4. battery                (seven Jev judgments, one call, battery.py)
    5. policy engine          (compose_action, policy.py: code, not Jev)
    6. pricing                (Avellaneda-Stoikov, pricing.py: code)
    7. risk veto              (hard limits, risk.py: code, absolute veto)
    8. execute                (cancel-replace post-only quotes plus directional leg)
    9. log, fills, inventory  (JSONL and latest.json for the dashboard)

Paper by default. `--mock` forces the mock decision client even if a real
key is present, useful for a clean demo run that can never fail on network
or billing grounds. A mock answers with random numbers, so any mock run
(forced, or fallen back to mid-run) is also a dry run: no orders at all. `--dry-execution` reads real market data and fires a
real Jev battery but never submits an order to Alpaca; every fill line
reads "dry" instead. Useful for testing the full pipeline without touching
the paper account. `--ticks 0` or `--forever` runs continuously until
stopped (Ctrl+C, or a SIGTERM if it is running in the background), and
cancels the resting orders it placed (only those, matched on this run's
client_order_id prefix) before it exits rather than leaving them behind. `--live` is a separate, deliberately awkward opt-in documented in
execution/alpaca.py and SKILL.md; paper is what every default here
resolves to unless a caller goes out of its way to ask for live.

Any asset `jevloop/assets.py` resolves: a crypto pair runs 24/7; a US
equity ticker only trades while the market is open, and the loop holds
(never orders) while it is closed, per `execution/alpaca.py`'s market-hours
guard.
